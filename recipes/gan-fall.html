        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1/4 of a Pumpkin</li>
            <li>Water</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Remove the pumpkin seeds and skin, and cut the fruit
                into thin cubes. Place fruit into a small pot, add 
                water and place the lid on the pot. Cook over a medium
                flame. Turn off the flame once the pumpkin has turned
                soft.
            </li>
            <li>Place the fruit in a blender, together with the Honey
                and the sugar. Blend till smooth, cool in refrigerator.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the cooled juice into glasses, and add the amount
                of milk you want. Stir and serve chilled. (Can also be
                served hot.)
